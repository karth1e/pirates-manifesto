# A Pirates Manifesto

> not complete!

This is a (possibly) brief collection (or guide) of all the tools, programs, apps, websites, resources, etc. that i use. **this is NOT an exhaustive list.** i am **not** the most experienced pirate, there are infinitely more comprehensive guides out there, which i will be mentioning. i am standing on the shoulders of giants, namely: r/piracy.

Note: this will be filled with rancor in all respects, i am still not f**king over how netflix cancelled "I Am Not Okay With This" which also incidentally describes my feelings of streaming services having complete control of what i can and cannot watch.

## Basics
These are things i think you NEED to have in order to have a remotely tolerable experience on the internet, as well as some other resources which makes the rest of this guide MUCH MUCH simpler. Trust me.

### Browser Extensions
We spend like 70% of our time on our browsers, makes sense to download stuff that make the user experience better.

- [Ublock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com): It is literally the only ad blocker youll ever need. Completely free, completely trustworthy, completely effective.

    > Ublock may be ineffective on youtube for certain users due to them being greedy and restricting users with adblock. Solutions posted later.

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) is extension used to run userscripts on browsers, userscripts open up a WORLD of possibilities and its always good to have this installed. Later quality of life improvements depend on this extension.

- [Terms of Service; Didn't Read](https://tosdr.org) is an extension that summarizes terms of services of various websites for you. It color codes the policies in red, yellow and green. Not everyones definition of essential; but its good to know what you are getting into when you click that tiny checkbox.

- [Consent-O-Matic](https://consentomatic.au.dk) is an extension that automatically rejects all pop ups on sites that try to broach your privacy. This isnt a perfect tool, but it works enough to be worth it.

- [Super Agent](https://super-agent.com) is an alternative for Consent-O-Matic. It's an extension that auto enables/disables cookies and popups for you based on your preferences. Does require login though, use at your own preference.

- [Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://github.com/bpc-clone/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean): Bit of a hassle to set up, but its an excellent way to remove paywalls on most news sites on Chrome/Chromium Based/Firefox browsers. [Paywall reader](https://paywallreader.com) is a site based alternative for this.
